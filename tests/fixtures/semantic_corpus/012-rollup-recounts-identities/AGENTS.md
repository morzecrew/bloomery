## Decisions governing `tests/fixtures/semantic_corpus/012-rollup-recounts-identities/`

### S-0053/D-2 — `LOCKED` (Measure semantic types and additivity algebra)

**A ratio is stored as its operands, not as a materialized quotient.** `SUM(num)/SUM(den)` and `AVG(ratio)` differ, the second is what a numeric-looking column invites, and the difference is a plausible wrong number. This is also S-0055's precondition — a derived metric spanning two branches cannot be reconstructed after the operands are gone — so reversing it later strands that document.

- Paths: `src/bloomery/emit/lower/rollups.py` `src/bloomery/errors.py` `src/bloomery/guardrails/additivity.py` `src/bloomery/guardrails/metrics.py` `src/bloomery/ir/nodes.py` `src/bloomery/quality/mart.py` `tests/fixtures/semantic_corpus/002-average-of-averages/expected/semantic_outcome.json` `tests/fixtures/semantic_corpus/002-average-of-averages/problem.md` `tests/fixtures/semantic_corpus/007-distinct-users-fanout/expected/semantic_outcome.json` `tests/fixtures/semantic_corpus/007-distinct-users-fanout/problem.md` `tests/fixtures/semantic_corpus/008-ratio-rollup/bloomery/declared/metrics.yaml` `tests/fixtures/semantic_corpus/008-ratio-rollup/bloomery/naive/metrics.yaml` `tests/fixtures/semantic_corpus/008-ratio-rollup/expected/semantic_outcome.json` `tests/fixtures/semantic_corpus/008-ratio-rollup/problem.md` `tests/fixtures/semantic_corpus/012-rollup-recounts-identities/problem.md` `tests/unit/test_emit/test_rollups.py` `tests/unit/test_guardrails/test_additivity.py` `tests/unit/test_guardrails/test_metrics.py` `tests/unit/test_steps/test_step_canonicals.py`
- Touching these paths owes a divergence entry: `torve log owed <task> --touched <files>` before you finish

### S-0055/D-8 — `OPEN` (Multi-grain aggregate-then-join query planning)

**Whether `DistinctCount`, `Snapshot` and `SemiAdditive` enter branch planning at all in P1.** §8 gates them on their proof rules being independently sound. Decide per class, with the corpus case each one converts, rather than as a group.

- Paths: `src/bloomery/ir/nodes.py` `src/bloomery/planner/semantic_plan.py` `src/bloomery/semantic/rollup.py` `tests/fixtures/semantic_corpus/007-distinct-users-fanout/problem.md` `tests/fixtures/semantic_corpus/012-rollup-recounts-identities/problem.md` `tests/unit/test_planner/test_coverage.py`

### S-0065/D-5 — `LOCKED` (Rollup marts and pre-aggregations)

An unprovable rollup is **refused**, never warned about. A rollup is read instead of the detail table, so a wrong one answers quickly and plausibly — the class this project refuses rather than approximates.

- Paths: `src/bloomery/cli/render.py` `src/bloomery/emit/sqlmesh/__init__.py` `src/bloomery/errors.py` `src/bloomery/evidence.py` `src/bloomery/guardrails/stage.py` `src/bloomery/marts/rollup.py` `src/bloomery/semantic/rollup.py` `tests/fixtures/semantic_corpus/012-rollup-recounts-identities/problem.md` `tests/unit/test_semantic/test_plan.py`
