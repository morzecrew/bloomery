## Decisions governing `tests/fixtures/semantic_corpus/005-semi-additive-balance/`

### S-0023/D-6 — `ASSUMED` (Guardrails: refusing plausible-but-wrong arithmetic)

Additivity: `non_additive` metrics are never materialized as stored numbers (components only); `semi_additive` metrics aggregate only over dimensions other than their `over:` dimension. Enforced at IR build **and** re-refused by emitters (S-0025) — defense in depth.

- Paths: `pages/docs/concepts/guardrails.md` `src/bloomery/guardrails/additivity.py` `src/bloomery/planner/coverage.py` `tests/fixtures/semantic_corpus/002-average-of-averages/expected/semantic_outcome.json` `tests/fixtures/semantic_corpus/002-average-of-averages/problem.md` `tests/fixtures/semantic_corpus/005-semi-additive-balance/problem.md` `tests/unit/test_guardrails/test_additivity.py`

### S-0053/D-1 — `LOCKED` (Measure semantic types and additivity algebra)

**The aggregation vocabulary is a closed typed set, never a target-interpreted string.** `Additive`, `SemiAdditive`, `NonAdditive`, `Ratio`, `DistinctCount`, `Snapshot`. Locked because the planner, the proof rules and every emitter branch on it: an open string set makes each target the authority for what a measure means, which is the arrangement this whole sequence exists to end. Staging the *implementation* across releases is fine; encoding a future class as a string is not.

- Touching these paths owes a divergence entry: `torve log owed <task> --touched <files>` before you finish
