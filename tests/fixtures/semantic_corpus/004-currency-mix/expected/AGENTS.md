### S-0023/D-4 — `ASSUMED` (Guardrails: refusing plausible-but-wrong arithmetic)

Currency codes are checked only when both operands declare one; distinct declared codes require an explicit `convert` transform. Absent codes are compatible — opt-in, unlike tax basis, so single-currency tenants aren't trained to paste constants.
