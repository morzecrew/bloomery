## Decisions governing `tests/fixtures/scd2_mart_refusal/`

### S-0040/D-1 — `LOCKED` (Temporal joins: SCD2 flattening and currency conversion)

Flattening an entity with `scd: type2` into a mart is **refused** at compile time, not silently emitted and not silently filtered to the current version. The join has no validity predicate and the relation has one row per version, so the emitted mart multiplies the base grain while every guardrail passes. Consequence: the only shipped way to use a historical dimension in a mart is a `type1` current-view entity built from it, until §5.3 exists.

### S-0040/D-2 — `LOCKED` (Temporal joins: SCD2 flattening and currency conversion)

A mart whose **`base`** is `scd: type2` is refused on the same account. There is no fan-out, but the declared `grain:` claims one row per entity while the relation holds one per version, so every measure counts revisions. Refusing both sides keeps "a mart's grain is what it says" true without exception.
